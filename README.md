Tired of the old app you have the looks like every other CRUD app with bootstrap?
How bout you spice it up a little with one inside a nutrition label?

This might be a huge miss, but I had a lot of fun working on this project.
I got the nutrion label idea from https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/egHEK*.
I also used his code to make the nutrion label itself.

To run my app follow these steps...
1. Fork this repo and go to your fork of the repo.
2. Under Repo name click Clone and copy URL given.
3. type "git clone " + paste URL.
4. Press enter  and your clone will be created.
5. Now open Index.html and have fun!


Thank you for taking time to look at my work!
