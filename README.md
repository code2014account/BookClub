Tired of the old app you have that looks like every other CRUD app with bootstrap?
How bout you spice it up a little and put it inside a nutrition label?

I had a lot of fun working on this project.
I got the nutrition label idea from https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/egHEK*.
I also used his code to make the nutrition label itself.

To run my app follow these steps...
1. Fork this repo and go to your fork of the repo.
2. Under Repo name click Clone and copy URL given.
3. type "git clone " + paste URL.
4. Press enter  and your clone will be created.
5. Now open Index.html and have fun!

If you don't want to open up the file locally you can see it running in full on codepen with this link...

With this SPA you can keep track of the books in your library. You can add new books, remove books, and change the name of the books in your library.

Thank you for taking time to look at my work!
